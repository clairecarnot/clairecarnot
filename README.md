# Hi there ! 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ About me
Full-stack developer looking for new professional opportunities (France, Paris).<br>
After 6 years working in Finance for international and fast-growing tech companies, I transitioned to IT in 2023 to study programming at 42 School.
I am now excited to keep learning, building, and contributing to impactful projects by bringing a unique mix of finance and technology experience.<br>

## 🗓️ My Journey
-  ### 📊 Finance career
I worked for 6 years as an auditor and then a financial controller at tech companies, in international and fast-paced environments. 
My finance experiences has given me a solid understanding of business needs, and I developped strong skills such as the ability to work as a team, managing juniors, or handling deadlines.
I also collaborated closely with developers on tech-driven projects, and have worked extensively with various tech tools (IS, CRM, accounting systems, Excel...).
-  ### 💻 42 School
The school cursus focuses on two main goals for its students: gain autonomy and develop solutions-finding abilities by coding individual projects, and develop the team-playing and communication skills through a peer-to-peer learning approach and sharing of knowledge.
I enjoyed building my technicall skills by working on hands-on projects and by learning to solve complex problems, working solo as well as with others.
<br><br>
This background helps me approach development with both technical and business perspectives in mind.
